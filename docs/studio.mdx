# Welcome to the Stately docs

Here you can find all the documentation for the Stately Studio and [XState](/xstate/intro). There are a few ways you might want to get started:

- ‚¨áÔ∏è Keep reading to [find out more about the Studio Editor](#studio-editor).
- üèÅ Jump straight into [learning how to use the Editor, starting with states](/states/intro).
- üß† Learn about [state machines and statecharts in our no-code introduction](/state-machines-and-statecharts).
- üíª Get started with [XState, our JavaScript and TypeScript library for state machines and statecharts](/xstate/intro).

The Stately Studio is a suite of tools for building app logic, including the Studio Editor, [developer tools for XState](/tools/developer-tools), and much more coming soon. 

<p>
<ThemedImage

    light: useBaseUrl('/studio.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/studio-dm.png'),
  }}
/>
</p>

You can use the [Studio Editor](#studio-editor) to model your logic using state machines and statecharts visually; no code required! Collaborate on your machines with coworkers and friends with [shared projects in teams](#projects-and-teams). Use the [XState VS Code extension](/tools/xstate-vscode-extension) to use the Editor with your codebase inside your code editor, or [export](#export) your code from the Studio into your codebase.

What are state machines and statecharts? We‚Äôre glad you asked! [Check out our no-code introduction to state machines and statecharts](/state-machines-and-statecharts).

## Studio Editor

The Studio Editor supports everything you need to visually build state machines and statecharts. The Editor currently has two modes; editor mode for creating your machines and simulation mode for simulating how your machine works.

### Editor mode

<p>
<ThemedImage
  alt="A dog walk machine open in the Stately Studio Editor in Edit mode. The running state is selected, with the right panel showing options for a state."
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/editor.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/editor-dm.png'),
  }}
/>
</p>

Visually add, modify, and delete states, events, and transitions, as well as data, including actions, descriptions, and invoked actors.

### Simulation mode

<p>
<ThemedImage
  alt="A dog walk machine open in the Stately Studio Editor in Simulate mode. The walking state is active, with the speed up and arrive home events both highlighted showing which events could be triggered next. The right panel shows an event log of the states and events taken."
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/simulate.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/simulate-dm.png'),
  }}
/>
</p>

Run the statechart, trigger events, and see the active state nodes.

### Export

You can also export machines to JSON, JavaScript and TypeScript, ready to be used in your codebase with [XState](/xstate/intro).

## Projects and teams

<p>

    dark: useBaseUrl('/projects-dm.png'),
  }}
/>
</p>

As a [Professional user](https://stately.ai/pricing), you can create and join teams in the Stately Studio to share your machines and collaborate on private team projects. [Read more about Projects](/projects) and [Teams](/teams).

## Discover machines

Are you seeking inspiration for your machine? Or do you want to learn from how somebody else models their machines?  The [Discover page](https://stately.ai/registry/discover) lists all the public machines created with the Stately Studio. [Read more about the Discover page](/discover).

## Our roadmap

Do you want to request a feature in the Stately Studio? [Check out our Canny roadmap](https://statelyai.canny.io) to post your feature idea and upvote other features. Our roadmap also shows you the features we have planned and those already in progress.

You can also keep up with the Stately team‚Äôs work in progress at our regular [office hour live streams](https://youtube.com/statelyai).
